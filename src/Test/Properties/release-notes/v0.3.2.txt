- Added Verifiable overloads to pass in the test class to which the verifiables should be added to.
- Make Verifiable methods that do not return a IMockVerifiable generic so that the setup can be configured further afterwards.
- Add Assert.IsEmpty and Assert.IsNotEmpty for IEnumerable.
- Added PrivateType and PrivateObject from old MSTest libraries.
- Updated dependencies.
